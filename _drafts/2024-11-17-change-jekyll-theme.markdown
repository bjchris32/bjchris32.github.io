## Context:
Originally, I have a jekyll with default theme. But, in this theme, I can not categorize the blog posts. So, I want to change the theme to support categories.


## Problem:
Problem is most of the themes mentioned that we need to fork their repository and copy-paste all of the posts.
I don't want to fork the theme. I want to reuse my original repository.

## Solution:
I found a SO, but there are still some errors: `fatal error`.
