## Work Smarter
### Configure your day
Match tasks to your energy levels:
* *Peak (morning)*: Focus on analytic work that requires concentration and vigilance.
* *Trough (early to mid-afternoon)*: Handle routine tasks that don’t require much brainpower.
* *Recovery (late afternoon/evening)*: Engage in creative work when your mood is up but vigilance is lower.

### Set priorities
* *Identify your Most Important Task (MIT)*: Each day, determine your most important task and complete it before anything else.
* *Create a To-Don’t List*: List three things that waste your time and energy, and make sure to avoid them.
* *Focus on Top Goals*: Inspired by Warren Buffett, list your top 25 life goals, then eliminate goals 6 through 25 to concentrate on the most crucial ones.

### Plan a project
* *Premortem Technique*: Imagine your project has failed and identify potential reasons for the failure. This helps anticipate and avoid problems.
* *Team Collaboration*: Gather your team to brainstorm possible issues, encouraging collective thinking and problem-solving.


### Motivate yourself
* *Progress Ritual*: At the end of each day, write down three ways you made progress. This helps you recognize your achievements and stay motivated.
* *Seinfeld Strategy*: Mark an “X” on a calendar for each day you complete a task. The visual chain of Xs encourages you to maintain consistency and not break the chain.


### Give and Get feedback
* *Actionable Feedback*: When giving feedback, make it specific and actionable. Instead of general comments, provide clear suggestions for improvement.
* *Wise Feedback*: Use the phrase “I’m giving you this feedback because I have high expectations for you and I know you can meet them” to make harsh feedback easier to accept.
* *Ask for Advice, Not Feedback*: When seeking feedback, ask for advice instead. People are more receptive to giving advice, and it tends to be more actionable and future-focused.

## Think Sharper 
### Tough decision
-> distance yourself
* If I were replaced tomorrow, what would my successors do?
* What would I tell my best friend to do?

### understand another’s perspective
* Persuading down:
	* Lower the power of myself -> increase the chance to take another’s perspectives
* Persuading up:
	* focus on interests -> What is in it for the boss?

### best way to persuade others
* Be ambiverts
	* somewhat introvert and somewhat extrovert
	* know when to speak up and when to shut up
* Bring social proof with you
	* Show that others are already doing what you are suggesting. This helps influence decisions by demonstrating common behavior. i.e. what other competitors do?
* Make it easy to act
	* Have I made it easy for others to do what I want them to do?

### Best way to come up with new ideas
* Generate
	* the only way to have good idea is to have a lot of ideas
	* Quantity more important than Quality
* Collect
	* Bring a note everywhere
* Socialize
	* get feedback from others
	* no one is gonna steal your idea

### Best way to reframe your language
* *From “should” to “could”*: Asking “What could I do?” instead of “What should I do?” opens up more possibilities and options.
* *From “can’t” to “don’t”*: Saying “I don’t” instead of “I can’t” helps you rely on your identity and rules rather than willpower.
* *From “have to” to “get to”*: Changing “I have to” to “I get to” shifts tasks from obligations to opportunities, enhancing intrinsic motivation.

## Live better
### Restore your energy
* *Something beats nothing*: Even a short break is better than no break at all. For example, a 20-second break every 20 minutes can be beneficial.
* *Moving beats stationary*: Taking breaks that involve movement, like walking, is more restorative than sitting.
* *Social beats solo*: Breaks with others are more restorative than breaks alone, even for introverts.
* *Outside beats inside*: Being in nature, even in small doses like a walk down a city street, is more restorative than staying indoors.
* *Fully detached beats semi-detached*: Completely disconnecting from work and leaving your phone behind during breaks is crucial for effective restoration. For example, 15 minutes walking and talking to someone you like.

### Deal with frustration
Life is full of setbacks and failures. We don’t have control over that, but we could control how we respond to them.
* *Reframe frustration as a test*: When you face a frustrating situation, take five minutes to think of it as a test of your creativity, resilience, and tenacity.
* *Benefits of reframing*: By viewing frustration as a test, your stress levels (cortisol) go down, and your problem-solving abilities improve.


### Overcome regret
* *Confront your regrets*: Instead of ignoring or wallowing in regrets, face them directly.
* *Three-step process*: Use the inward, outward, forward approach:
	* *Inward*: Practice self-compassion and treat yourself with kindness.
	* *Outward*: Talk or write about your regrets to unburden yourself and make sense of them.
	* *Forward*: Learn from your regrets and apply those lessons in the future.

### Connect with others
* *Assume positive intent*: Start interactions by believing others have good intentions. This approach leads to better work and personal relationships.
* *“tell me more”*: When in disagreements, use this phrase to understand the other person’s perspective and build a connection.
* *When in doubt, reach out*: If you’re unsure about reconnecting with someone, go ahead and do it. It’s usually less awkward than expected, and the other person will likely appreciate it.

### Deepen your sense of meaning
* *What’s Your Sentence?*: Identify a single sentence that captures the essence of your purpose and what you aim to achieve in life.
* *Mental Subtraction of Positive Events*: Imagine your life without a significant positive event to deepen your sense of gratitude and meaning.
