## Science behind motivations
* *If-then rewards* (e.g., “If you do this, then you get that”) are highly effective for simple tasks with short time horizons.
* These same rewards are *less effective for complex tasks* with longer time horizons because they narrow focus and limit creativity.
* Organizations should *apply if-then rewards* for simple tasks but use different motivational strategies for complex, long-term tasks to foster enduring motivation and creativity.
* money matters, so pay fairly

## Purpose
* two types of purpose
	* making a significant impact, like solving major global issues
	* making a contribution in everyday tasks, like improving customer experience
* Ask yourself
	* Is my team making a difference or a contribution?
* How to promote purpose?
	* let everyone know whose purpose it is?
		* 15 minutes exercise:
			* distribute a stack of cards to every team members to write down the purpose of the organization anonymously
			* check if
				* the idea is consistent in the card
				* blank card indicates there might be a warning sign in the organization
	* turn any conversation of “how“ to complete a task into “why” we need to complete the task
		* connect to the purpose of organization purpose and personal development

	* building belonging
		* let belonging emerge from the bottom, so just be an observer instead of organizing mandatory happy hour


## Mastery
* summon intrinsic motivation with progress ritual
	* give yourself feedback
		* take 60 seconds to type three things you got done today

* Weekly one-on-ones with a twist: frequent and informal
	* week 1-3: Checkin by the following questions
		* How are you doing?
		* What do you need?
	* week 4: Twist
		* have a different, more in-depth customized conversation about topics such as what the employee loves or loathes about their job

* How to give negative feedback?
	* Acknowledge that negative feedback is often uncomfortable for both the giver and receiver, but using the right approach can make it a positive experience.
	* Wise feedback:
> I’m giving you these comments because I have very high expectations, and I know that you can reach them


## Autonomy
* Why?
	* *Autonomy for All Jobs*: Every job, regardless of its nature, deserves a level of autonomy and self-direction.
* How?
	* *Job Crafting*: Encouraging employees to craft their jobs in ways that are personally meaningful can lead to higher engagement and job satisfaction.

	* Autonomy made up of decision latitude and control. It could lead to the following results:

|                  | High Control | Low Control |
|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **High Challenge** | Flow(optimal autonomy)         | Burnout(they want to quit)     |
| **Low Challenge**  | Drift(need to give them challenges)        | Monotony(boring job)    |


* Manager need to ask themself:
	* Do my teammates have control of what they are doing?
	* Do they doing something challenging?

* Autonomy Audit for all employee on scale 1-10
	* How much do you feel the autonomy over your tasks
	* How much over your time?
	* How much over your team? Who you work?
	* How much over technique to solve the problem on tasks?

* Create small periods of pure autonomy
	* for example, spend one hour a week to go somewhere else and figure out what could be improve in the task.
