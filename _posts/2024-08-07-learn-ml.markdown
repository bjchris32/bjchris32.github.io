I would like to learn more about machine learning and build something interesting in my free time.
Problem is I am so done with the online courses, because those classes requires you to take the bundle of courses and to learn something I might have known before.
As a result, I looked up the discussions from reddit and found a curriculum [here](https://github.com/llSourcell/LearnML)
The goal of the curriculum is to learn how to build and deploy a ML application in the end.
Since most of them are reading materials, I could pick up what I want and tailer those resource into my own learning path.

## My goal:
- I would like to learn more about machine learning, deep learning, and then GenAI.
- Other than building projects in the journey, I would like to deploy them on the web.
- Also, I am interested in visualize the data and explain what the model tells us.

## My background:
- I've learned general AI and machine learning concepts in grad school, but I did not have more in-depth knowledges in deep learning.
- When I was taking machine learning in signal processing, I've learned PCA, ICA to reduce dimension. So, I'll skip them.

## Adjusted resource:

### For month 1: Machine Learning
Since I've gained knowledges in python and mathematics, though I am not good at math, I will start from week 3.
#### week 3: Data visualization
Learning resource is from [kaggle learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn)
Some topics that interst me are:
- [ ] [Intermediate Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning/course): est. 4 hours
- [ ] [Data Visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization): est. 4 hours
- [ ] [Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering): est. 5 hours
- [ ] [Machine Learning Explainability](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning-explainability): est. 4 hours

#### week 4: Build and visualize random forest regression model
learning resource is from [IPython Cookbook](https://github.com/ipython-books/cookbook-2nd)
- [ ] [random forest](https://github.com/ipython-books/cookbook-2nd/blob/master/chapter08_ml/06_random_forest.md)

### For month 2: Deep Learning (est. TBD)
The overlapped materials people talks about are:
- fastAI's course [Practical Deep Learning](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson1.html)
- a text book [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/).


### For month 3: MLOps (est. TBD)
Follow the same material listed in github.
