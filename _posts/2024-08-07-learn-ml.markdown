I would like to learn more about machine learning and build something interesting in my free time.
Problem is I am so done with the online courses, because those classes requires you to take the bundle of courses and to learn something I might have known before.
As a result, I looked up the discussions from reddit and found a curriculum [here](https://github.com/llSourcell/LearnML)
The goal of the curriculum is to learn how to build and deploy a ML application in the end.
Since most of them are reading materials, I could pick up what I want and tailer those resource into my own learning path.

## My goal:
- I would like to learn more about machine learning, deep learning, and then GenAI.
- Other than building projects in the journey, I would like to deploy them on the web.
- Also, I am interested in visualize the data and explain what the model tells us.

## My background:
- I've learned general AI and machine learning concepts in grad school, but I did not have more in-depth knowledges in deep learning.
- When I was taking machine learning in signal processing, I've learned PCA, ICA to reduce dimension. So, I'll skip them.

# Routine:
The schedule each week would be as followed.
Day 1 - 4: Reading material, lesson and exercise implementation
Day 5 - 6: Assignment implementation
Day 7: Document, share and self-reflection on my plan/goal.

## Adjusted resource:

### For month 1: Machine Learning
Since I've gained knowledges in python and mathematics, I will start from week 3 from [LearnML](https://github.com/llSourcell/LearnML) and extend my learning from [kaggle learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn)

#### week 1 - 4: Data visualization
Some topics that interst me are:
- [Intermediate Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning/course): est. 4 hours
- [Data Visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization): est. 1 hours
    - I just want to review different method to explain the data. So, I only need to read the tutorial in [summarized tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexisbcook/choosing-plot-types-and-custom-styles)
- [Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering): est. 5 hours
- [Machine Learning Explainability](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning-explainability): est. 4 hours

### For month 2: Deep Learning
The overlapped materials people talks about are:
- fastAI's course [Practical Deep Learning](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson1.html)
- a text book [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/).
FastAI's course looks more interesting to me, so I will explore FastAI's course and plan to learn more from this material.

#### Week 1: Neural Networks
- Practical Deep Learning(Part 1): est. 14 hours
- Dive into Deep Learning(Chapter 3. - Chapter 9.): est. 10 hours
- Assignment: on github.

#### Week 2: Transformers(HuggingFace)
- Follow the NLP course in hugginface: est 10 hours lesson and 20+ hours implementation
- Assignment: on github.

#### Week 3: GenAI - Diffusion(FastAI)
- Follow all courses in Part 2: 15 hours lesson and 20+ hours implementation
- Assignment: on github.

#### Week 4: Deep Reinforcement Learning(Simonini Thomas)
- Follow syllabus [Deep Reinforcement Learning Course](https://simoninithomas.github.io/deep-rl-course/)(8 Units): est. 16 hours lesson and 20+ hours implementation
- Assignment: on github.

### For month 3: GenAI/MLOps (est. TBD)
* Kaggle [5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/5-day-genai)

## reference resources:
* [LearnML](https://github.com/llSourcell/LearnML)
