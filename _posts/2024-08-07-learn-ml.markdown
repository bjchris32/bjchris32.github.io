I would like to learn more about machine learning and build something interesting in my free time.
Problem is I am so done with the online courses, because those classes requires you to take the bundle of courses and to learn something I might have known before.
As a result, I looked up the discussions from reddit and found a curriculum [here](https://github.com/llSourcell/LearnML)
The goal of the curriculum is to learn how to build and deploy a ML application in the end.
Since most of them are reading materials, I could pick up what I want and tailer those resource into my own learning path.

## My goal:
- I would like to learn more about machine learning, deep learning, and then GenAI.
- Other than building projects in the journey, I would like to deploy them on the web.
- Also, I am interested in visualize the data and explain what the model tells us.

## My background:
- I've learned general AI and machine learning concepts in grad school, but I did not have more in-depth knowledges in deep learning.
- When I was taking machine learning in signal processing, I've learned PCA, ICA to reduce dimension. So, I'll skip them.

# Routine:
The schedule each week would be as followed.
Day 1 - 4: Reading material, lesson and exercise implementation
Day 5 - 6: Assignment implementation
Day 7: Document, share and self-reflection on my plan/goal.

## Adjusted resource:

### Milestone 1: Machine Learning
Since I've gained knowledges in python and mathematics, I will start from week 3 from [LearnML](https://github.com/llSourcell/LearnML) and extend my learning from [kaggle learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn)

#### week 1 - 4: Data visualization
Some topics that interst me are:
- [Intermediate Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning/course): est. 4 hours
- [Data Visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization): est. 1 hours
    - I just want to review different method to explain the data. So, I only need to read the tutorial in [summarized tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexisbcook/choosing-plot-types-and-custom-styles)
- [Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering): est. 5 hours
- [Machine Learning Explainability](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning-explainability): est. 4 hours

#### Reflections:
- The kaggle material are easy to follow and they did not put too much challenges for me. I will need to adjust the plans in month 2 to get more challengs and implement more projects.
- I want to make the plan as milestones instead of month, because I felt more comfortable when there are some other commitments to focus on.

### Milestone 2: Deep Learning
The overlapped materials people talks about are:
- fastAI's course [Practical Deep Learning](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson1.html)
- a text book [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/).
FastAI's course looks more interesting to me, so I will explore FastAI's course and plan to learn more from this material and make the materials from the curriculum as supplement resources.

#### Milestone 2.1.1: Neural Networks
- Practical Deep Learning(Part 1): est. 14 hours
- Dive into Deep Learning(Chapter 3. - Chapter 9.): est. 10 hours
- Assignment: on github.

##### Reflection for Milestone 2.1:
It is unrealistic to complete part 1 in 14 hours. because the steps to get full reward from the class is to watch the video, reproduce the notebookm, and apply the model on different dataset or do the additional assignment.
I only completed lesson 1-3 and realtead reading. I will adjust the plan to work on lesson, reproduce the result or implementation.

#### Milestone 2.1.2: Neural Networks

- Textbook:
    - 04_mnist_basics
    - 05_pet_breeds
    - 06_multicat

- Small Tasks:
    - Run 04_mnist_basics.ipynb in Colab
    - Watch lesson 5
    - Run 05_pet_breeds notebook and modify dataset
    - Try 06_multicat for multi-label example
    - Apply augmentation tricks from 07_sizing_and_tta

    - Train a small model
        - Make predictions on a test set.
        - Check metrics (accuracy, F1, etc.).
    - Optional mini-project: Quick Colab notebook of text classifier ready to share or save.
