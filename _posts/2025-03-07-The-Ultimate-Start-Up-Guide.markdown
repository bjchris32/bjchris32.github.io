After reading this book, I found even if I don't start up a business, I could improve the way I think about my career path, the way I talk to others in a presentation.

## How to generate idea?
* Start with why(customers’ need) instead of what(technology)
	* customers’ need: the hole in market

* Two component to develop:
	* Vision
		* to investors
			* is there disruption? -> create new market/customers
	* Function spectrum
		* to target audience
			* is there any relevance? -> will it solve my problem?
* How to develop the two components?
	* Vision First:
		* how to scale? Where to go?
	* Identify
		* what should be insource and outsource?
		* For example, marketing website could be outsourced.
	* Monitor and validation
		* explore more audience

* What are the thought process to generate the ideas?
	* Phase1
		* So what is the result when there is the hole in the market?
		* Who cares?
	
	* Phase2:
		* What is the specific problem
		* Who has it?
		* Do they know they are picked?
		* What’s the cost for them?
		* How much would they pay?



## Where is the Market and Customers?
* What market to explore?
> You can’t create new/unique category of your market
Because you don’t have time or money to do that.

* How to develop customers?
	* Phase 1:
		* discover: the customer out of echo chamber
		* validate: trial on early customers
	* Phase 2:
		* invest: build company
		* create: the mainstream sales
			* get feedback from early adopters
				* combine feedback from customers and product manager
				* then, introduce to mainstream sales

## How to Pitch?
*  Style
	* likable & self-aware & saler mode
	* sit down
* Slides
	* test with “who cares / so what”
* Structure to generate the conversation with V.C.:
	* start with “Luck”: to meet the investors
	* White teeth: the speaker should be appealing
	* More date: to have more time to talk about the product
	* Tech: how to achieve it

* Example:
	* “We can…”
	* “What if I told you that you could …”

* Conclude with answers:
	* Why this area?
	* Why with us?
	* Why now?
	* tips: don’t repeat the product or summary

* more reference: presentation Zen.

## How to Hire?
* Principle:
	* Hire to the organization chart
	* Talent over diversity
* How to hire?
	* get investors involved
	* go outsource and virtual (on-demand)


## Put up a Website
* There is not too much credential that you can not put on website

> If you don’t have any competition, you don’t have a market.
-> Website should help customer or investors understand your market better and your unique place in it.

## How to divide the Equity?
* 1/3 founders
* 1/3 employees
	* may run the risk in leaving current job
* 1/3 investors

* TODO: check dilution in equity

## VC
* How to pick right VC?
	* Domain expertise
	* in-house service
	* initial customer referral
* How to maintain relationship with VC?
	* build team and help early sale
	* help grow company in operation or management
* Have more mentors than just VCs
