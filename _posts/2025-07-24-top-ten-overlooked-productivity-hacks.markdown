# Top ten overlooked productivity hacks
## Workflow productivity hacks
### Get things done
* *Plan Realistically:* Assess how long tasks will realistically take, considering Hofstadter’s law, which states that things always take longer than expected.
* *Set self-imposed realistic deadlines:* you share it with others
* *Avoid relying on willpower:* stop telling yourself “My willpower will kick in, so I can wait to get started”. Just get started, or there will be more stress.
* *Break Tasks into Smaller Steps:* Start with either the hardest or easiest tasks to build momentum and manage your energy effectively.

### Embrace the value of leaving it alone
* *Restraint Over Reaction:* Sometimes, it’s more productive to wait and see how things play out rather than reacting immediately.
* *Patience Over Pursuit:* Avoid unproductive behaviors like sending multiple follow-up emails or pointing out flaws unnecessarily.
* *Productivity Boost:* By not engaging in unproductive actions, you can achieve better outcomes with less effort and stress.

## Personal productivity hacks
### Redirect rhythm
* *Create Space:* Take a breath to create distance from the intensity of the emotion. “Take a breath”
* *Name the Emotion:* Identify and name the emotion you are feeling to reduce its hold over you. Answer: “What am I feeling?”
* *Reassess:* Use logic to reassess the situation and challenge the story you are telling yourself. Answer: “What’s really happening?”
* *Redirect:* Ask yourself “What’s next?” to engage in a more productive behavior. 

### Let go of debilitating emotions
* *Identify and Release the Festering Four*: Regret, guilt, shame, and self-pity are identified as the four debilitating emotions that hinder productivity. Letting go of these emotions is crucial.
* *Counter with Acceptance, Forgiveness, and Introspection*: Regret, guilt, and shame can be countered by accepting your mistakes, forgiving yourself, and reflecting on past experiences to learn and move forward.
* *Shift from Self-Pity to Gratitude*: Replace self-pity with gratitude by changing your mindset from “I have to do this” to “I get to do this,” which can reframe your day positively and boost productivity.


### Create a color coded work plan
* *Classify Your Work*: Use a color-coded system to classify your work into red, green, and gold categories based on value and contribution to meaningful goals and personal growth.
	* *Red Work*: Low-value, unproductive tasks that should be minimized or eliminated.
	* *Green Work*: Core, high-value tasks that meet business needs and leverage your strengths.
	* *Gold Work*: Highly significant tasks that contribute to your legacy and long-term goals.
* *Evaluate and Reshape*: Honestly assess your current work portfolio to identify and minimize red work, ensure green work is truly valuable, and seek or create gold work opportunities.
* *Intentionality*: Be intentional about how you spend your time and focus on work that is productive and meaningful to enhance your overall productivity and fulfillment.

## Others-oriented productivity hacks
### Harness the hardwire phenomenon to get others’ help
* *Fuel Reciprocity*: Help others first, and they will feel compelled to return the favor due to the principle of reciprocity.
* *Give 10% More*: Always add extra value in your interactions, encouraging others to reciprocate with higher effort when helping you.
* *Link Agendas*: Align your goals with others’ agendas to create a common mission, fostering mutual support and productivity.
* *Appeal to Desired Identities*: Use identity-based language (e.g., “be a helper” instead of “help”) to increase the likelihood of others assisting you.
	* Instead of asking someone, “Can you help me with this project?” you could say, “Can you be a helper on this project?” By using the word “helper,” you appeal to their desire to be seen as helpful, which increases the likelihood that they will assist you. 

### Seek Planck knowledge to efficiently learn from others
* *Planck Knowledge vs. Prattle*: Planck Knowledge is deep, credible knowledge gained through experience and expertise, while prattle is superficial understanding.
* *Identifying Planck Knowledge*: Ask if the person has enough experience, if others consider them credible, and if they share truly valuable insights.
* *Learning from Experts*: Focus on learning from those with Planck Knowledge to boost your productivity and gain meaningful insights

* How to identify whom has Planck knowledge?
	* Do they have enough experience in their field?
	* Have others advocated from them as credible experts?
	* Are they teaching things that are true?

### Mind the 25/65/95 Rule to hold people accountable
* *Accountability Boosts Productivity*: The 25/65/95 rule shows that accountability significantly increases the likelihood of achieving goals—from 25% to 95% when you have regular accountability appointments.
* *Three Key Questions*: In accountability appointments, discuss:
	1. Where are we making progress or excuses?
	2. Where are we owning the issue or avoiding the issue?
	3. Where are we being brave or blaming?
* *Honest Discussions*: These questions help highlight good work, minimize excuses, encourage ownership of issues, and promote bravery over blame, driving accountability and productivity.

## Organizational productivity hacks
### Maximize motivation
* Am I doing enough to keep employees energized?
* Am I adding or subtracting their energy?

### What is SEAM(Start and End A Meeting) rule to get the most out of meeting?
* How to Start a meeting?
	* start meetings on time. Late starts can significantly reduce meeting effectiveness and idea quality.
* How to End a meeting?
	* Ask the question: "Who will do what by when?"
